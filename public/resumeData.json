    "bio":"I am a big fan of pursuing a active lifestyle. Physical activities boost up my confidence level and help me stay focused. Coding is a problem-solving skill which requires a lot of mental strength, which can be achieved through regular physical exercise. I find coding very interesting because it never stops being challenging. I believe that only challenge can bring the best out of a man. I first began learning about programming at Seneca. I learned C,C++,Java and JavaScript and a lot other technologies, frameworks and libraries. Currently my focus is solely on JavaScript. I started solving different problems at HackerRank to sharpen my JavaScript skills.",
